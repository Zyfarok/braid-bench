Benchmarks and tools for Braid, a storage-advice generator for Proof of Usable Space. + Thesis source

* In `blockgen-bench` you have an implementation of Braid and we benchmark it's raw performances at computing storage advices.
* In `drivebench` you have a small application to benchmark random read speeds of a drive on a (by default) 64 GiB file.
* In `poufs-poc` you have a proof of concept of a Proof of Space encoding and decoding functionnality on files.
